## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Template Deployment

1. Head over to [RunPod.io](https://runpod.io?ref=0eayrc3z)
2. Click on `Deploy` and select `Template`
3. Search for `WanVideo - ComfyUI Manager - AllInOne1.0`
4. Choose your preferred GPU
5. Hit that `Deploy` button! üéâ

### 2. Environment Variables

When deploying, you can set these environment variables to control the startup behavior:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SKIP_DOWNLOADS` | Set to `true` to skip model downloads | `false` |
| `SKIP_NODES` | Set to `true` to skip node installations | `false` |
| `JUPYTERLAB_PASSWORD` | Set a password for JupyterLab | Empty (no password) |
| `PUBLIC_KEY` | Your SSH public key for secure access | Empty (SSH disabled) |

These are especially useful when:
- Using network drives or persistent storage
- Redeploying pods frequently
- You've already downloaded models and want faster startup


### 2. Accessing Your Instance

Once your pod is up and running, you'll see several URLs in your pod's overview:

- Will take around 20-25 mins to download all the models. Give it a few minutes after "‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê   ALL DONE - STARTING COMFYUI ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"

- üé® **ComfyUI**: `https://your-pod-id-8188.proxy.runpod.net`
- üìì **JupyterLab**: `https://your-pod-id-8888.proxy.runpod.net`
- üîç **Image Browser**: `https://your-pod-id-8181.proxy.runpod.net`

### 3. Working with JupyterLab

- To set a password. on ENV template set JUPYTERLAB_PASSWORD = "password"
- Access JupyterLab using the URL from your pod's overview
- Default password is empty (just press Enter)
- All your work will be saved in the `/workspace` directory

### 4. Using the Image Browser

The template includes the Infinite Image Browser tool to help you manage ComfyUI output videos and images:

- Access the browser at `https://your-pod-id-8181.proxy.runpod.net`
- Or use the JupyterLab notebook at `/workspace/ComfyUI_Image_Browser.ipynb`
- Browse, search, and manage your ComfyUI output files
- Right-click on images/videos for additional options
- Search by filename, creation date, and metadata

### 5. SSH Access (Optional)

To enable SSH access:
1. Set your `PUBLIC_KEY` in the template settings
2. Connect using: `ssh -p <port> runpod@<ip-address>` Full link available on connect button on Runpod

## üì• Downloading Models

This template includes a powerful and flexible system for downloading models using the `download-files.sh` script and a configuration file.

### Using the download-files.sh System

The template includes a convenient, configurable download system that makes it easy to manage model downloads:

1. **Edit the configuration file**:
   ```bash
   nano /workspace/files.txt
   ```

2. **Add model entries in this format**:
   ```
   type|folder|filename|url
   ```
   Where:
   - `type`: Use `normal` for direct downloads or `gdrive` for Google Drive files
   - `folder`: Destination subfolder (checkpoints, loras, embeddings, etc.)
   - `filename`: What to name the downloaded file
   - `url`: The download URL

   Example entries:
   ```
   normal|checkpoints|model1.safetensors|https://huggingface.co/org/model/resolve/main/model1.safetensors
   normal|loras|lora1.safetensors|https://civitai.com/api/download/models/12345
   gdrive|loras|lora_from_drive.safetensors|https://drive.google.com/uc?id=your_file_id
   ```

3. **Run the download script**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   ./download-files.sh
   ```

4. **Monitor progress**:
   - The script shows download progress for each file
   - Each file is verified after download
   - A summary report is provided at the end

### Benefits of the files.txt System

- **Reproducible setup**: Document all your models in one place
- **Batch downloads**: Set up many downloads to run unattended
- **Cross-platform**: Works with Hugging Face, Civitai, Google Drive, and more
- **Automatic organization**: Files go to the correct folders automatically
- **Error handling**: Failed downloads are reported but don't stop the process
- **Verification**: Ensures all downloads completed successfully

### Direct Downloads (Alternative Method)

For one-off downloads, you can use wget directly:

1. Navigate to your desired directory:
```bash
cd /workspace/ComfyUI/models/checkpoints
```

2. Download using wget:
```bash
wget -O model_name.safetensors https://huggingface.co/model/resolve/main/model.safetensors
```

3. For large files with progress bar:
```bash
wget -q --show-progress https://huggingface.co/model/resolve/main/model.safetensors
```

4. For Civitai files with authentication:
```bash
wget -O model.safetensors "https://civitai.com/api/download/models/12345?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&token=your_token"
```

### Using files.txt

The template includes a file-based download system:

1. Edit `/workspace/files.txt` with your model information
2. Run the download script:
```bash
./download-files.sh
```

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with sample workflows** found in the ComfyUI interface
2. **For high-quality videos**, use longer CFG values (7-9) and higher sampling steps (25+)
3. **Manage your VRAM** by using lower resolution for initial tests
4. **Use Text Prompts effectively** - detailed prompts work best with Wan Video models
5. **Browse and manage outputs** using the Infinite Image Browser

## üîß Troubleshooting

- If ComfyUI doesn't start, check the logs in JupyterLab terminal
- If models aren't loading, verify they downloaded correctly in `/ComfyUI/models/`
- For custom node issues, try restarting your pod or reinstalling via ComfyUI Manager
